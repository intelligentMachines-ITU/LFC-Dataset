Detecting firearms and accurately localizing indi-
viduals carrying them in images or videos is of paramount
importance in security, surveillance, and content customization.
However, this task presents significant challenges in complex
environments due to clutter and the diverse shapes of firearms. To
address this problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages
human-firearm interaction information, which provides valuable
clues for localizing firearm carriers. Our approach incorporates
an attention mechanism that effectively distinguishes humans and
firearms from the background by focusing on relevant areas.
Additionally, we introduce a saliency-driven locality-preserving
constraint to learn essential features while preserving foreground
information in the input image. By combining these components,
our approach achieves exceptional results on a newly proposed
dataset. To handle inputs of varying sizes, we pass paired human-
firearm instances with attention masks as channels through a
deep network for feature computation, utilizing an adaptive
average pooling layer. We extensively evaluate our approach
against existing methods in human-object interaction detection
and achieve significant results (AP=77.8%) compared to the base-
line approach (AP=63.1%). This demonstrates the effectiveness
of leveraging attention mechanisms and saliency-driven locality
preservation for accurate human-firearm interaction detection.
